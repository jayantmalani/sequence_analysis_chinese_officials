Military very easily moves into party jobs, easily moves into centrl or province. jobs.

Very hard to move into military.

Almost no one starts there careers as B8. B8 is a desireable place to end your career. It's a symbolic job.

Y to B* easy, Y to A's harder, Y to A4 impossible

From the data: ?????
B1,B3,B6,B7 
B2,B4,B5

From the theory (via GDP):
B3 (highest, best GDP) slight scheme
B1
B2
B4
B5
B6
B7



Looks like people who were in any Bs were roughly as likely to get into As.

Fairly difficult to get into A4 from B*, more easily from A1-3

Only can get into B8 from A1 and A2, B8 from any other is impossible.

B8 to anything should be nearly impossible.

Questions:
Are B1 and B3 great places for getting into A1

Make substitution cost between A1 and A2 very cheap.

A to B1-7 impossible.

One dimensional matrix for addition or deletion.

Expensive to delete B8, B's

Make insertion costs for Bs high, deletion costs low.

A1~A2
A3~A4
A3/A4 -> A2/A1 (more likely, low cost)
A2/A1 -> A3/A4 (less likely, higher cost)
A

A3,4 to A1 higher than than A1 to A3,4

Insertion of Y hard, deletion of Y easy (because you can go anywhere from Y, but can't easily go to Y). Same for Y.

No C directly to A4
No Ys ever in A4
